This repository contains some code as a support for the PhD course
"Evaluating Efficacy and Efficiency of Machine Learning Models", held
at the Milan University during academic year 2023/24.

The first part, focusing on efficacy evaluation, is based on the following
material:

- S. Raschka, Model Evaluation, Model Selection, and Algorithm Selection in
  Machine Learning, https://https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12808
- T. G. Dietterich, Approximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised
  Classification Learning Algorithms, Neural Computation 10 (7), 1998,
  1985-1923
- T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, The Elements of Statistical
  Learning, Chapter 7: Model Assessment and Selection,

- B. S. Everitt, The Analysis of Contingency Tables, Chapters 1 and 2, Chapman
  & Hall, 1977
